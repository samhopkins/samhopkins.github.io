## Algorithmic Statistics (6.S896), Fall '23, MIT

**Prerequisites:** Mathematical maturity is the main prerequisite. Familiarity with linear algebra, probability, discrete math, and algorithms at the advanced undergraduate level will be assumed.

**Meeting time:** Tuesdays and Thursdays, 2:30pm-4:00pm

**Location:** 32-124

**Instructors:** [Costis Daskalakis](http://people.csail.mit.edu/costis/) and [Sam Hopkins](../../index.html)

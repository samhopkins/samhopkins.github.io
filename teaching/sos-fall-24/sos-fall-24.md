## The Sum of Squares Method (MIT 6.S977), Fall '24

In this course we will study of algorithms and computational complexity through the lens of the Sum of Squares method (SoS), a powerful approach to algorithm design generalizing linear programming and spectral methods. We will choose some specific sub-topics based on student input, potentially including algorithms for combinatorial and continuous optimization (graphs, constraint satisfaction problems, unique games conjecture), applications to high-dimensional algorithmic statistics (robustness, privacy, method of moments), applications to quantum information, and an SoS perspective on computational complexity (of NP-hard problems and/or of statistical inference).

**Prerequisites:** Mathematical maturity is the main prerequisite. Familiarity with linear algebra, probability, discrete math, and algorithms at the advanced undergraduate level will be assumed.

**Meeting time:** Tuesdays and Thursdays, 9:30am -- 11:00am

**Location:** 3-442

**Instructor:** [Sam Hopkins](../../index.html)

**Office Hours:** Tuesdays, 11:15am -- 12:15pm

**Evaluation:** Students will be expected to complete several problem sets and a research-oriented course project, which may consist of original research (theoretical and/or experimental!) and/or an exposition of 1 or 2 recent research papers.
In addition, students will participate in grading each others' problem sets via a peer grading and feedback system.
Weight for your final grade will be split: 50% psets, 10%  peer grading, 40% course project.

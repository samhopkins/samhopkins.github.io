## The Sum of Squares Method (MIT 6.S977), Fall '24

In this course we will study of algorithms and computational complexity through the lens of the Sum of Squares method (SoS), a powerful approach to algorithm design generalizing linear programming and spectral methods. We will choose some specific sub-topics based on student input, potentially including algorithms for combinatorial and continuous optimization (graphs, constraint satisfaction problems, unique games conjecture), applications to high-dimensional algorithmic statistics (robustness, privacy, method of moments), applications to quantum information, and an SoS perspective on computational complexity (of NP-hard problems and/or of statistical inference).

**Prerequisites:** Mathematical maturity is the main prerequisite. Familiarity with linear algebra, probability, discrete math, and algorithms at the advanced undergraduate level will be assumed.

**Meeting time:** Tuesdays and Thursdays, 9:30am -- 11:00am

**Location:** 3-442

**Instructor:** [Sam Hopkins](../../index.html)

**Office Hours:** Tuesdays, 11:15am -- 12:15pm, 32-G666.

**Evaluation:** Students will be expected to complete several problem sets and a research-oriented course project, which may consist of original research (theoretical and/or experimental!) and/or an exposition of 1 or 2 recent research papers.
In addition, students will provide peer reviews for each others' problem set solutions and course projects.
Weight for your final grade will be split: 40% psets, 20% peer reviews, 40% course project.

[Instructions](grading.pdf) for peer review.

**Collaboration policy:** You may collaborate with your peers on your problem sets in the following manner. You can have meetings to discuss and solve problems. At the end of a meeting, all records from the meeting must be destroyed. (No written notes, no whiteboard/chalkboard photos, etc.) Then, you must write your solutions on your own.

The course project can be done in groups of $2$.

**Collaborating with Google and AI Chatbots:** While doing psets, you can ask Google/ChatGPT/Claude/Llama/etc questions about background material but not detailed questions about a particular problem. This will be policed on the honor system, i.e. not at all. 

Example question which is within bounds: *What is the expected value of $\exp(-g^2 t^2)$ when $g$ is a standard Gaussian?*

Example question which is out of bounds: *How do I prove that pinning reduces global correlation?*

I am a theoretical computer scientist and Assistant Professor at MIT, in the [Theory of Computing](https://toc.csail.mit.edu/) group in the [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/), where I hold the Jamieson Career Development Chair.

Previously, I was a [Miller](http://miller.berkeley.edu/) fellow in the [theory of computing group](http://theory.cs.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, hosted by [Prasad Raghavendra](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~prasad/) and [Luca Trevisan](https://lucatrevisan.github.io/). Before that, I got my PhD at [Cornell](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/research/theory), advised by [David Steurer](http://www.dsteurer.org/).

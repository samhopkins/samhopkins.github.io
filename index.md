I am an Assistant Professor at MIT, in the [Theory of Computing](https://toc.csail.mit.edu/) group in the [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/). If you are interested in working with me as a PhD student, please [apply](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics-admissions/graduate-program/admissions) to MIT's EECS PhD program!

Previously, I was a [Miller](http://miller.berkeley.edu/) fellow in the [theory group](http://theory.cs.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, hosted by [Prasad Raghavendra](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~prasad/) and [Luca Trevisan](https://lucatrevisan.github.io/). Before that, I got my PhD at [Cornell](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/research/theory), advised by [David Steurer](http://www.dsteurer.org/).

### Notes

I have been supported by a Simons Postdoctoral Fellowship and a Miller Postdoctoral Fellowship, both at UC Berkeley. As a PhD student, I received support from a  Microsoft PhD Fellowship, an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, and a Cornell University Fellowship.

I am Samuel B. Hopkins. Maybe you are looking for [Samuel Francis Hopkins](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~shopkins/)?

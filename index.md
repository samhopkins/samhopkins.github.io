# Samuel Hopkins

*algorithms, theoretical machine learning, semidefinite programming, sum of squares optimization, convex hierarchies, and hardness of approximation.*

I am a [Miller](http://miller.berkeley.edu/) fellow in the [theory group](http://theory.cs.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, where I am hosted by [Prasad Raghavendra](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~prasad/) and [Luca Trevisan](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~luca/). Before that, I got my PhD at [Cornell](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/research/theory) under [David Steurer](http://www.dsteurer.org/)'s watchful eyes.

### Other Writing
Blog posts I wrote on clustering and learning high-dimensional mixture models using the SoS method (originally appeared on [Windows on Theory](https://windowsontheory.org/). [pdf](clustering.pdf)

Notes on tensor decomposition using the SoS method (originally notes for a guest lecture at Stanford). [pdf](tensor-decomp-notes.pdf)


### Notes

Currently I am supported by the Miller Fellowship at UC Berkeley. In the past, I have received support from by Microsoft PhD Fellowship, an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, and a Cornell University Fellowship.

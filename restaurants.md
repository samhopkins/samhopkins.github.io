# Restuarants

Sometimes people ask me where to eat in places I've lived at various times. Here is a partial and opinionated and disorganized list.


## Berkeley

This list is current as of September 2021.

### (Relatively) convenient to campus

*Imm Thai Street Food* Best Thai in walking distance to campus

*Cafe Mezzo* Giant salads and sandwiches. Split one with your friend.

*Gregoire* French takeout. Nap required afterwards.

*Jupiter* Acceptable pizza and beer, good patio.

*Triple Rock* Burgers, better beer, worse patio.

*Kiraku* Excellent Japanese food, mostly fish (not sushi). Usually a wait. Somewhat pricey. Order the rice in dashi/tea at the end of the meal when you are hopefully a little drunk.

*Ippuku* Almost as excellent Japanese food, mostly yakitori.


### Less convenient

*Emilia's* Best pizza in Berkeley. Best in the East Bay. Must call ahead.

*Zachary's* Deep dish pizza. Good atmosphere. Good pizza, if you like that sort of thing.

*Standard Fare* Best lunch in Berkeley. Chez Panisse trained chef now making excellent sandwiches.

*Middle East Market* Persian takeout counter.

*Sam's Log Cabin* Breakfast/brunch.

*Funky Elephant* Outstanding Thai food. Probably the best in the Bay Area. 

*Vik's Chaat* Indian.

*Cholita Linda* Cuban, mostly. Order the cubano.

*Cheeseboard* Pizza is overrated, but great baked goods in the mornings.

*Caravaggio* Outstanding gelato.


## Ithaca

I last lived in Ithaca in December of 2017, some of this may be a little out of date.

*Cafe Dewitt* Optimal brunch.

*Mousewood* AVOID.

*Saigon Kitchen* Very decent Vietnamese.

*Ithaca Brewing Company* Acceptable beer, great patio (in summer).

*Sweet Melissa's Ice Cream* Soft serve. Open in summer only.

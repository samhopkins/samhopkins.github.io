# The Sum of Squares Method: Fall 2022 Seminar at MIT

## Course Description
Study of algorithms and computational complexity through the lens of the Sum of Squares method (SoS), a powerful approach to algorithm design generalizing linear programming and spectral methods. Specific sub-topics vary and are chosen with student input, potentially including algorithms for combinatorial and continuous optimization (graphs, constraint satisfaction problems, unique games conjecture), applications to high-dimensional algorithmic statistics (robustness, privacy, method of moments), applications to quantum information, and an SoS perspective on computational complexity (of NP-hard problems and/or of statistical inference).

Meeting time: Fridays, 9:30am -- 12:30am.

Instructor: Sam Hopkins
